					<h4>Verse 1</h4>
					<p>
						Take a look around me
						Taking pages from a magazine
						Been looking for the answers
						Ever since we were seventeen
						You know the truth can be a weapon
						To fight this world of ill intentions
						A new answer to the same question
						How many times will you learn the same lesson?
					</p>
				
					<p>
						I think they got it all wrong
						We just gotta hold on
						And on, and on, and on
					</p>
				
					<p>
						'Cause we're gonna be legends <em>(Ooh)</em>
						Gonna get their attention <em>(Ooh)</em>
						What we're doing here ain't just scary
						It's about to be legendary
						Yeah, we're gonna be legends <em>(Ooh)</em>
						Gonna teach 'em all a lesson <em>(Ooh)</em>
						Got this feeling in our souls we carry
						It's about to be <strong>legendary</strong>

					<h4>Verse 2</h4>
					<p>
						This is what we came for
						And we couldn't want it anymore
						We could never turn back now
						Got to leave it all on the floor
						Been dreaming of the payoff
						Through the struggles and the trade-offs
						Fighting tooth and nail on the way up
						Tell them the truth, but they think it's just made up
					</p>
				
					<p>
						And I think they got it all wrong
						We just gotta hold on
						And on, and on, and on
					</p>
				
					<p>
						'Cause we're gonna be legends <em>(Legends)</em>
						Gonna get their attention <em>(Attention)</em>
						What we're doing here ain't just scary
						It's about to be legendary
						Yeah, we're gonna be legends <em>(Legends)</em>
						Gonna teach 'em all a lesson <em>(Lesson)</em>
						Got this feeling in our souls we carry
						It's about to be <strong>legendary</strong>

						Eventually, they're gonna know who's right
						To make a stand, you've got to win the fight
						Can't stand the heat, then just stay out the light
						For you might never make it out alive
						You gotta live without a compromise
						Let everybody hear your battle cry
